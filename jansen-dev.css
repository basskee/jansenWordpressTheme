STEP 1: BAKING
first start by taking the purple power and pouring it into your bowl. make sure it fills the bowl atleast three inches.
follow this by putting the dollar bills into the bowl, and and put the bowl into the microwave for about 5 minutes. ( be sure to fully submerge every bill fully into the bowl before putting in the microwave.)
STEP 2: CLEANING
first and very important because the purple power will eat your skin away, WEAR THE RUBBER GLOVES!
Now with that said, after the bills have been out of the microwave and have set for about a minute take and rub your gloved fingers across al of the bills this will knock the top layer of ink off.
Put bowl back into microwave so that solution regains heat.
now take one bill out and put it on your counter ( i suggest laying down a thin rubberized table cloth, the material  can be bought by the role, is very cheap, and will hold the bill in place while assuring your counters stay safe.) now take your electric tooth brush and dip into the purple power. repeat this several times per bill to assure the bill stay wet this will prevent taring.
with the tooth brush, starts scrubbing the bill in a circular motion. not to hard, you dont want to tare the bill, but heavily enough to brush the ink off. when done with the front side, dip the bill in the purple power once again,  and then repeat brushing process on the back. ONCE DONE WITH THE BILL I SUGGEST RUNNING HOT WATER OVER IT TO FULLY CLEAN THE REST OF THE BILL.
REPEAT CLEANING STEP ON ALL OF YOUR BILLS.

STEP 3: DRYING
Now take the wet bills and lay them on a towel. one by one, using the blow dryer, dry the bills completely until they are crsp. you should be left with blank dollar bills.

STEP 4: PRINTING
now say you want to make a novelty (FAKE) 20 dollar bill. first you will need a good dummy bill. a dummy bill is the bill you intend to clone. it needs to be in great shap. no rips, tares, creases, or defects.
place this bill on the copier and make a black and whit copy.
(LEAVE THE BILL ON THE COPIER, DO NOT TOUCH IT!)
Now you take this photocopy,  and you outline it the bill with the double sided tape. only cover the sides of the photo copied bill by about an 8th of an inch. now take one of the blank bills and place it directly over the photo coppied image of the 20 dollar bill. take the sheet of paper and place it back into the printer, and this time instead of black and white, make a color copy of the 20 dollar bill. presto. you now have a counterfeit 20. just repeat the printing process on the back.

This will pass the pen test because it is the same material as a 20 dollar bill ( considering at one time it was a legit bill until you cleaned it of its ink ) the better quality printer you buy will obviously give you the better quality product.
